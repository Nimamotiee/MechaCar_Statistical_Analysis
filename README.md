### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Per the above screenshot, both Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provided a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Meaning they provided a significant impact on the MPG of the prototypes.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
Per the screenshot, the P value appears to be significantly smaller in value than the assumed Alpha of .05 therefore reject our null hypo and further indcate that the slope of this linear model is not zero

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Per the calc, R square = .7149 which means that 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model therefore yes predicts effectively.
